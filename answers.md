- **2)**
W(n) = W(n - 1) + W(n - 2) + C

W(n) = 2W(n-1) + C W(n) = 4W(n-2) + 3C W(n) = 8W(n-3) + 3C

W(n) = 2^k (n - k) + (2^k - 1)C

W(0):
n - k = 0
k = n W(n) = 2^k W(0) + (2^n - 1)C â‰ˆ 2^n

Therefore, the work of the algorithm is O(2^n)

- **3)**
S(n) = S(n-1) + 1

root value = 1 
level 1 value = 1

(the recursion tree is balanced --> max cost per level multiplied by the number of levels)

1 * n --> Therefore, the span of the algorithm belongs in O(n)

- **4)**
The value of counts will grow like the Fibonacci sequence does, representing how many times the Fibonacci sequence is called when computing the Fibonacci number in question.

For example: counts[1] and counts[0] will both be called only once while counts[4] will be called for n=4 once and each time for n=3 and n=2 and n=1

- **6)**
The maximum times it will be called is n. The algorithm will be called from the input of n until it reaches 0. Hence, the work and span will both be n. Therefore, it is a linear function.

- **8)**
It will be read twice since we are taking the input n and checking n-1 and n-2 (two separate times). Additionally, it will have a work and span of O(n) because it is also a linear function proportional to the number n. However, the function is not performed recursively.
